# What is a regular expression (Regex)?
A regex, or regular expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.A regex can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern that we are looking for. The simplest regex or regular expression is one literal character long.

# What is Thompson's construction?
Thompson's construction is a method of transforming a regular expression into an equivalent nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). The algorithm works recursively by splitting an expression into its constituent subexpressions, from which the NFA will be constructed using a set of rules. This algorithm was created by Kenneth Lane Thompson, a computer scientist in America. Ken Thompson is famous for a variety of computing contributions such as the creation of the "B" Programming language.

# What is the shunting yard algorithm?
The shunting-yard algorithm is a method for parsing mathematical expressions specified in infix notation. It can produce either a postfix notation string. The algorithm was invented by Edsger Dijkstra and named the "shunting yard" algorithm because its operation resembles that of a railroad shunting yard.
